# Create a file in workflow
Here, a random number will be created and written to a txt file.  

From a shell, a random number can be created with `$RANDOM`. Try with `echo $RANDOM`.  
Writing a random number to a file could be dome with `echo $RANDOM >> randomNumber.txt`.  

This will happen on the runner vm.
