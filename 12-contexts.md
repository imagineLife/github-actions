# On Github contexts
Contexts are objects that hold data that can be accessed from the workflow env.  

The workflow file has access to a handful of "contexts" out-of-the-box.  

see [the gitlab docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts) for a longer write-up of this stuff!
